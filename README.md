![Extension Icon](icons/logo-128.png)

A Mozilla Firefox-based web extension built using the Manifest v2 version that aims to remind and notify the user to take breaks (during their time browsing the web or completing other activities) to:
* Rehydrate and drink some water
* Readjust your vision after focusing on a screen
* Correct your posture while sitting
* Get up and stretch about

Each of these options are able to be toggled from the extension pop-up (when clicking on the icon in your browser), and can be configured for custom durations between notifications (based on studies for recommended time ranges for each type of break).
