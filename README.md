![Extension Icon](icons/logo-128.png)

A Mozilla Firefox-based web extension that aims to remind and notify users to take breaks (during their time browsing the web or completing other activities) to:
* Readjusting your vision after focusing on a screen <ins>*(15 - 30 mins)*</ins>
* Correcting your posture while sitting down <ins>*(20 - 45 mins)*</ins>
* Get up and stretching your body after sitting for a while <ins>*(30 - 60 mins)*</ins>
* Re-hydrating by drinking some water <ins>*(45 - 90 mins)*</ins>

Each of these options are able to be toggled from the extension pop-up (when clicking on the icon in your browser), and can be configured for custom timers between notifications (based on studies for recommended time ranges for each type of break).
